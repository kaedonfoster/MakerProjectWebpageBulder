This Website builder took me roughly 6 weeks working every weekend on this and a few class times!
My computer teacher last year challenged me to learn and create a program like this, and I have done it!

To run this program just download the files and run the .exe file. 
You will be prompted with a page that allows you to name your files. After you hit the big create button, you will have access to the whole program!
The program allows you to do things like set header text, set body text, change colours of both text, align text to either center,left,or right, and you 
can also change background colour! I have made this program to allow you to create two pages! If you inspect the webpage once you have built it, you will see that the
code is very organized. I have made it write to both a css and an html file!
This program has around 1000 lines of code! I am very impressed with how this turned out! If I had more time I would have made alot more features.
